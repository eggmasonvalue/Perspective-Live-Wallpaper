## 🌌 The Concept

Time famously "flies". **Horizon** renders it as a precise, modular grid of geometry, allowing you a frequent dose of perspective at a glance.

### 🔭 Perspective (Life Calendar)
Your life clock on your lock screen.
- **The Grid**: Each unit represents **one year**

### 🚀 Momentum (Day Counter)
Focus your energy on the immediate future.
- **The Grid**: Each unit represents **one day**
- **The Modes**:
    - **"There is no tomorrow"**: one visible shape for today (breathing).
    - **"You vs. You, yesterday"**: Two visible shapes - one for today (breathing) and one for yesterday.
    - **"Custom"**: classic deadline tracking.

## ✨ Features

### 🎨 Deep Customization
Make the horizon yours with the new **Style** engine:
- **Shape Shifting**: Choose your primitive—**Circle**, **Rounded Square** (Classic), or **Rhombus** (Rotated Square).
- **Density Control**: Adjust the grid scale from **0.5x** (airy, minimalist) to **1.0x** (dense, data-rich).
- **Container Padding**: Fine-tune the margin around the grid for perfect alignment with your device's bezels.
- **Colors**: Select from preset color schemes or define your own custom palette.
- **System Theme**: Adapts to Material You (Monet) on supported devices.

### ✒️ Typography
- **Lato**: The app features the **Lato** typeface bundled directly into the core, ensuring crisp, professional typography on every device.

### ⚡ Performance
- **Zero Battery Drain**: The engine sleeps when not visible.
- **Native Rendering**: Built with Android's native Canvas API for fluid 60fps animations.
